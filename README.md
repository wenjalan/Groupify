# Groupify  
A Spotify app that makes playlists based off you and your friends' tastes. No more squabbling with collaborative playlists or wrestling for the aux cord.  

## Development Roadmap  
1. Prototyping Stage
2. Website Launch 
3. Refinement and Fine Tuning (current stage)  

## How Does it Work?
Groupify will take you and your friends' top tracks, artists, and genres and pick out which ones you share. It'll then create a playlist based off those things, and throw in a few recommendations here and there.
